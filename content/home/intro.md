Hi, I'm Bill! I'm an undergraduate student at [UCLA](http://www.ucla.edu/) studying [Computer Science](https://www.cs.ucla.edu/). I was a software engineering
intern at [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/) and an iOS developer intern at [InTouch Health](https://intouchhealth.com/). I'm also an officer for 
[ACM ICPC](https://www.uclaacm.com/) at UCLA and a mentorship chair at [UCLA UPE](https://upe.seas.ucla.edu/)! Check out some of my projects below!
